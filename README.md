Project: HL7 Parser with dbt

Overview
This project provides a solution for parsing HL7 files using dbt (data build tool). HL7 (Health Level Seven) messages are widely used in the healthcare industry for exchanging information between different systems. This parser helps transform HL7 data into a structured format using dbt models, making it easier to analyze and integrate with other data sources.

Features
HL7 Parsing: The project includes dbt models designed to parse HL7 messages.
Structured Output: Transforms HL7 data into structured tables suitable for analysis.
Example HL7 Files: Sample HL7 files are provided for testing and demonstration purposes.
